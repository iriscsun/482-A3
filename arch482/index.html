				<p> <b>Hello World!</b> My name is Iris Sun and I am currently a Senior in Informatics with a focus in Data Science. I love
				analyzing and pulling meaning out of data, as well as creating visualizations that make information easy to understand
				and fun to interact with. I was born and raised in Seattle, I really love it here but will be moving to the bay after
				graduation! Outside of school, I love working out and being active.
			<br><br>
				I am <b>very excited</b> to be taking this class as I love programming but do not have much experience in web development.
				Through my major, I have taken one client side development class. We covered A LOT of content very quickly, so I feel
				as if I did not retain much. Through work, I have created a few different websites using wordpress and drupal. I really
				enjoy the user experience aspect that goes into website design. Looking forward to a fun quarter!</p>
